# Your Project's Name

This project is called 'EZ Finder'. It helps the user locate the nearest carparks within a 1 km radius around a particular point. This can be done by either marking a point on the map or searching a particular location in the search bar.
 
## Design Process
 
This website is designed for drivers that do not know where the nearest carparks in a particular location are and want to have a fast and efficient way to locate these carparks. This website searches the nearest carparks around a location just by entering its address. It loads fast and shows the name of the carpark, in case the driver needs more information about it (e.g. Operating hours, parking fees, etc)

User Stories:
    As a driver, I want to locate the nearest carpark so that I can park at a place that I do not need to travel far from.

Adobe XD was used in my design process.

## Features

There are two main features in the website
    1. Open Map Feature: 
    Double click on a random point on the map and it will show nearby carparks within a 1km radius. Clicking on the carpark marker will display its information.

    2. Carpark Search Feature: 
    Enter the address of a location and it will show nearby carparks within a 1km radius. Clicking on the carpark marker will display its information.

Both these features serve the same purpose of searching for nearby carparks.

## Testing

First Commit: I added a placeholder navigation bar and the CarparkFinder feature. This was when i decided to do the carpark search application instead of the game idea I originally had. This was because I realised my original idea does not have a meaningful way to include an API and doing this idea was a good way to utilised the Google Maps API.

Second Commit: I added the MapLocation feature, but without the markers that indicate the nearby carparks.

Third Commit: I combined the two features I originally had and create CarparkFinder 2.0

Fourth Commit: I finished the navigation bar and touched up on the CarparkFinder feature.
